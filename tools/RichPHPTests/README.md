# RichPHPTests

A custom PHP unit and integration testing framework to support running test suites via CLI and WI.

## Basic Usage
From the command line:
```console
php path\to\RichPHPTests.php path\to\tests
```

Tests are discovered recursively within the `path\to\tests` folder supplied.

Inside the `path\to\tests` folder is where you place your required tests `config.json` file.

This accepts the name for the test suite as well as any excluded test classes (comma separated array), like so:

```json
{
    "name": "Some Test Suite",
    "exclude_tests": [
        "SomeTest2"
    ]
}
```

Excluded files do not need the `.php` extension added.

## Writing Tests

Test examples can be found inside the `Tests` folder for this tool.

Each test class should have its own file, with the test class having as many test methods as required.

Test classes must extend the `TestCase` class in the framework, with proper namespacing.

Each test method name must start with `test`, have public visibility, be non-static, and return void.

Example:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use RichPHPTests\TestCase;

class SomeTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testIsTrue(): void
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

Available assertion methods can be found in the [Includes\Assert\Assert.php](Includes/Assert/Assert.php) class.

### Setup and Teardown

You can add methods to your test classes for setting up and tearing down any variables needed for each test.

The `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods are called before and after every test method, respectively. `setUpClass()` is called only once before any test methods in a class, and `tearDownClass()` is called only once after all test methods in a class have run. Make note of the visibility and retun types.

```php
protected function setUp(): void {}

protected function tearDown(): void {}

public function setUpClass(): void {}

public function tearDownClass(): void {}
```

## Example CLI Output

When run from the command line, assuming no fatal errors were raised, the output will look something like this for all passing tests:

```console
> php "path\to\RichPHPTests.php" "path\to\tests\folder"

Running test suite: Some Test Suite
Tests complete.
Tests ran: 9, Passed: 9, Failed: 0. Skipped Files: 1
```

Or if any tests failed, the output will look like this:

```console
> php "path\to\RichPHPTests.php" "path\to\tests\folder"

Running test suite: Some Test Suite
Tests complete.
Tests ran: 9, Passed: 7, Failed: 2. Skipped Files: 1
The following tests failed:
SomeTest::testStringMatches2 : File: SomeTest.php - Line: 24 - Expected: 'String2' - Actual: 'String1' - Error: Strings are not the same.
SomeTest::testArrayIsEmpty : File: SomeTest.php - Line: 44 - Expected: 0 - Actual: 1 - Error: Array is not the right size.
```

## Additional Information

You can include a `bootstrap.php` file in your root `path\to\tests` directory if required. This can be used to carry out any additional logic or setup for the entire test suite, for example to autoload any classes or define constants.

## Purpose
**RichPHPTests** serves as an additional project for the Innovation Project submission for Richard Webster's dissertation for 2022, University of Chester module CO6008.
